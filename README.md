# Fusion
A 2048 knockoff, but easier.

## Gameplay
1. Swipe to move all tiles towards the walls of the board.
1. When two tiles with the same number touch, they will merge together.
1. The goal is to hit the current target (128 for now) before the board fills up.

## Potential Improvements
1. The animations are not _always_ working; further investigation needed.
1. Additional modes/targets, board shapes, etc.
